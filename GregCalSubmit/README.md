## Analysis Steps
The analysis steps of the program were figuring out the problem that the program needed to solve. For this assignment, the problem was to create a calendar using the GregorianCalendar and Calendar Classes to create a program that would display whichever month calendar for the month/year the user enters.

### Design
To design this program I started by looking at the documentation linked in the resource video prodived by instructor.
I then utilized what I learned from scanning through that documentation to implement into my program.
Doing so, I first imported my calendar classes, created those objects, and added a scanner.
The scanner was to allow the user to input their desired month/year, rather than being hard coded.
The calendar then runs and outputs the correct month and year the user entered along with its corresponding month calendar.

### Testing

Tesing this was fun, not really. I had to code a few different versions of this assignment
to figure out how it was intended to be created. I had tested out trying to create a calendar program
without using the classes, and that confused me (obviously since it wasn't the direction of the assignment)
After I cleared this misunderstanding up, I started testing my new program with classes and resources from documentation.
Testing this involved commenting out a lot of lines to figure out which one was breaking
the program, as well as I tried out var data type for the first time to get it to run with a data type error just for test purposes.
 Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

Enter a month (1-12): 5
Enter year: 2000

RESULT:
