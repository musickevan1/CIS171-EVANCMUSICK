# Project Title

JavaFX GUI for a completed Hangman game

## Project Description

This project is a JavaFX graphical user interface (GUI) that displays a completed Hangman game with a stand, head, arms, legs, and body. The program draws the hangman using lines and shapes on a canvas. This is a simple example of how to create a GUI with JavaFX.

## Example Output

## Analysis Steps

The requirements for this project were to create a graphical representation of a completed Hangman game with a stand, head, arms, legs, and body using JavaFX. The analysis involved determining the appropriate shapes and dimensions to use for each body part and determining the positioning of each body part in relation to the canvas. 

### Design

The design of this program involved creating a single class that extended the `Application` class in JavaFX. The `start()` method was overridden to draw the hangman on a canvas using a `GraphicsContext` object. 

### Testing

1. Verify that the program window appears and displays the Hangman game.
2. Verify that the stand is drawn correctly.
3. Verify that the head is drawn correctly.
4. Verify that the body is drawn correctly.
5. Verify that the arms are drawn correctly.
6. Verify that the legs are drawn correctly.

## Notes

No issues or additional testing instructions.
