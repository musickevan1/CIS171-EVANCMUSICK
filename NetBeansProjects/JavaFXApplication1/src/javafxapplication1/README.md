Ch 14 GUI Informational Display

This program is a JavaFX application that creates a graphical user interface (GUI) window. The windows contains a heading text with custom font size/weight,
an image from the internet, a non-editable text box, and a non-working button. The elements are organized using a VBox, which is a layout container that stacks
its children vertically. The scene is set on the primary stage is then shown to the user, displaying our first GUI!

## Analysis Steps

This section should restate the assignment and explain how you analyzed the requirements in order 
to develop a solution.

Created a GUI using JavaFX and added elements including an Image, Textbox, Button, & Heading.

### Design

How did you approach your program design? Did you use multiple classes to define various objects?

I used the JavaFX library to complete this project. I utilized videos in the book, as well as the book, and documentation to apply in my GUI project.

```
Give examples
```

### Testing

A step by step series of examples that you developed to properly test the program. 

Say what the step will be

I tested the program by running it in NETBEANS after installing the JavaFX library and Zulu.

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
