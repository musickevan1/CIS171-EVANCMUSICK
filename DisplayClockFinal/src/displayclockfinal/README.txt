## Example Output

## Analysis Steps

This program was developed as an exercise in Java programming. The requirements were to display an analog clock and provide a way for the user to start and stop it.

### Design

The program was designed using two classes: `DisplayClock` and `ClockPane`. The `DisplayClock` class is responsible for creating the JavaFX window and adding the clock to it. The `ClockPane` class defines the clock itself and handles the drawing of the clock hands.

### Testing

To test the program, the following steps were taken:

1. Run the program by executing the `DisplayClock` class.
2. Verify that the clock is displayed and running.
3. Click the "Stop" button to stop the clock.
4. Click the "Start" button to start the clock again.
5. Close the window to exit the program.

## Notes

No special instructions or issues were encountered during testing.
