# Project Title
Shuffling an ArrayList in Java

## Project Description
This project implements a Java program that shuffles an ArrayList of elements using the Collections.shuffle() method provided by the Java standard library.

## Example Output
Here's an example output of the program:

## Sample Output

## Analysis Steps
This program implements a single method, shuffle(), that shuffles the elements of an ArrayList. The method uses the Collections.shuffle() method to shuffle the elements, which is a safe and efficient way to perform the desired operation.

## Design
The program consists of a single Java class named Main. The Main class defines a shuffle() method that takes an ArrayList of type E as a parameter and shuffles its elements using the Collections.shuffle() method.

### Testing
To test the program, we create an ArrayList of integers, add some values to it, and then call the shuffle() method to shuffle the elements. We then print the original ArrayList and the shuffled ArrayList to verify that the elements have been shuffled correctly.

Here's an example test case:

Create an ArrayList of integers: numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Call the shuffle() method to shuffle the elements: shuffle(numbers)
Print the original ArrayList: Original ArrayList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Print the shuffled ArrayList: Shuffled ArrayList: [3, 5, 1, 4, 2]
## Notes
This program is a simple implementation of shuffling an ArrayList in Java, and should not encounter any issues or unexpected behavior.
